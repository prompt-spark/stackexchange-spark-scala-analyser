And with a new or difficult material, it might be worth using the printer's LCD menu (if present) or control software to manually extrude some filament before even trying to run a part file at all.  On some printers you have to do this by commanding it to heat the nozzle and then finding the menu where you can move the extruder (or it is geared, disables the steppers and turn it by hand).  On others, there's a move filament or manual extrude setting that achieves temperature and movement together." CreationDate="2016-04-17T19:14:21.900" UserId="1378" />

I did a small test with an M3 bolt and nut. If, as you say, the shells and infill are adequate, I don't need a washer. I just need the hole tolerance to be tight enough that the nut won't slip into the hole. So an M3 bolt needs a 3.2mm hole (as printed) - I tried and I can't even begin to pull it through (by hand at least). As my load is 4kg max I think I can do without. Interestingly, I can flex the ABS at 4mm so that's suddenly more important!" CreationDate="2017-04-21T12:20:40.990" UserId="6827" />

You don't want the filament too warm when it goes back, may stick to lining, etc, which is what the heat-break helps with. Bowden configs require extra tuning / calibration and will generally have a much higher retraction speed / distance.

Priming blobs are very useful indeed, they are commonly used. After the blob the filament should retract, the head moves and then extrudes to fill the cavity in the nozzle again."

  <row Id="14035" PostId="8387" Score="0" Text="Hi Oscar, thanks for your response. The problem is that the filament retracts while moving from priming to actual print. This causes there to be no filament loaded in the extruder when the actual print starts" CreationDate="2019-03-01T22:56:52.760" UserId="14693" />

It looks as if the positioning is not very accurate causing some filament to be printed with an offset to the previous layer as seen by the bulged out filament."
